# econ-wiki
A python script to get biographical information (birth and death dates) on people pulled from Wikipedia, used to aid in Cornell economics research.

Usage notes: You may need to do "pip3 install wikipedia" (the python wikipedia library), if you don't already have it. It's recommended to use a virtualenv to do so.
